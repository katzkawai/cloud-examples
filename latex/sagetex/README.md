Sage + LaTeX = SageTeX
======================

This demos how Sage and LaTeX can be combined.

Automatic Mode
--------------

Just click on the `*.tex` files and the two-pane editor should show up.
SageTex and BibTex is run automatically, too!

Manual Mode
-----------

Edit the `.tex` file, compile it via `latexmk filename.tex` in the Terminal.

If you change some Sage commands, you have to re-run `sage filename.sagetex.sage`
in order to incorporate the changes in the output.
