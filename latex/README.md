SageMathCloud LaTeX Support
===========================

SageMathCloud allows you to run LaTeX online in a full Linux environment.
It supports the standard compilers, `latexmk`, and a large number of libraries are pre-installed.
On top of that, `SageTeX` adds the capability of running SageMath code right inside of TeX files to seamlessly embed code, results, formulas and plots.

The directory `sagetex` shows how to run SageMath inside a document,
and `multiple-files` demonstrates how to setup a larger LaTeX document with multiple source files.
