\chapter{Subfiles Package}

The subfiles \LaTeX package~\cite{subfiles}
is able to combine multiple source files
in one single document.
In contrast to other commands like \verb|\input| or \verb|\include|,
it is also possible to render the partial document with
the header definitions of the master document.

Also, in the header of each subfile,
additional instructions can be embedded.
In this example here,
\verb|\setcounter{chapter}{1}| sets the counter for the chapter
in order to get a consistent numbering.
(Otherwise -- because \LaTeX only sees this partical document --
it would start its numbering at 1 and not 2.)
